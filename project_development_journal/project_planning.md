# Project Development Journal

## Day 1
I wrote the first iteration of README.md. I articulated the problem, my proposed solution, and my proposed method of programming my solution.

### Research Topics for Day 2
- Topic modeling (start with DeepLearning.AI)
    - LDA and neural networks for topic modeling
- Summarization (start with DeepLearning.AI)
- NLP Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Things to Do/Figure Out Day 2
- Practice smaller scale models (try topic modeling tutorials) and familiarize with input/output
- What method of topic modeling to try first
- Where/How to collect training/testing data

### *Main Goal for Day 2: Learn*
